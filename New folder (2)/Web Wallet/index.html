              <h2 class="title2">Private Keys</h2>
              <p class="">
              In cryptocurrency, private keys are essential for accessing and controlling your funds. Web wallets typically store your private keys on the server, which means users rely on the security measures implemented by the wallet provider to protect their assets. Some web wallets offer additional security features like two-factor authentication (2FA) to enhance protection.

              <h2 class="title2">Security Concerns</h2>
              <p class="">
              Web wallets come with security concerns, as they are connected to the internet and controlled by a third-party provider. If the wallet provider's security measures are compromised or if the provider becomes a target of a cyberattack, users' funds could be at risk. Therefore, it's crucial to choose a reputable and secure web wallet provider.

              <h2 class="title2">Custodial vs. Non-Custodial</h2>
              <p class="">
              Web wallets can be categorized into custodial and non-custodial types. Custodial web wallets store users' private keys on their behalf, while non-custodial web wallets allow users to retain control of their private keys. Non-custodial web wallets are generally considered more secure as users have full control over their funds.

              While web wallets are convenient, users should exercise caution and follow best practices for security. It's advisable to keep only small amounts of cryptocurrency in a web wallet for everyday use and store larger amounts in more secure storage options like hardware wallets or paper wallets.

However, users should carefully choose a reputable provider, enable additional security measures, and be aware of the security risks associated with storing cryptocurrencies in web wallets.
